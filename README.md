## 📜 Executive Summary

**AETHER C2** is a custom engineered Command & Control framework designed to demonstrate advanced offensive security concepts. Unlike standard reverse shells, Aether project operates on a **Full Duplex, End-to-End Encrypted** channel, utilizing direct WinAPI syscalls for evasion and a modular architecture for scalability.

> **⚠️ SECURITY NOTICE:** To prevent misuse by unauthorized actors, the specific decryption routines and injection logic in this public release have been **redacted/abstracted**. This repository serves as a technical portfolio demonstrating architecture, OPSEC logic, and software engineering skills.

## 🧠 Technical Architecture


### 🛡️ The Implant (Rust)
* **Memory Safety:** Built in Rust to prevent buffer overflows and ensure stability during operations.
* **Evasion:** * **Jitter:** Randomized sleep intervals to defeat heuristic traffic analysis.
    * **WinHTTP:** Uses direct system calls, bypassing high-level proxy hooks.
* **Identity:** Generates unique, persistent cryptographically secure identities for each agent.

### 📡 The Server (Python)
* **Asynchronous Handling:** Multi-threaded listener capable of handling concurrent beacons.
* **Crypto Protocol (Phantom v6):** * **ECDH (P-256):** Ephemeral Key Exchange per session.
    * **AES-256-GCM:** Authenticated Encryption for all payloads.

```rust
const C2_IP_ADDRESS: &str = "127.0.0.1";

2.
cd Implant
cargo build --release


3.
cd Server
python server_apt.py
